## Trouble Shooting

## About The Project
This is the first project of our last 6 weeks of the back-end engineering project at the Turing School. We walked a mile in the shoes of our front-end peers, and learned a lot about JavaScript, jQuery, and how do make an app without a database.

The styling was heavily inspired by [Travis.ci](https://travis-ci.org/).
